# prophet-prototype
First self-created web-page with CSS, Bootstrap and HTML.
Most of the part is followed along with Angela Yu's web-course on Udemy.
She created a "tindog" page, I used mostly the same structure as her, with a different design-approach.

The idea of prophet is that you can rent a AI-Bitcoin-trading bot, funny huh?

With this page I started my web-development journey. Currentyl I'm a 23 year old computer-scientist student at the RWTH-University, Aachen, Germany.

The university is great, but heavy in theory and mathematics. Programming is rarley seen in day-to-day studying. This is the reason I started learning web-development and maschine learning as a side-project. 

My "long-term" - goal, is to create a webpage called dgtlAge.com (already bought the domain hehe) where I would like to publish "easy" Deeplearning Bots (Chess, Tic Tac Toe, etc.) which are able to play against humans and learn with a every "real" match. 

Happy to be part of this new community (for me). See you!
